# Rubik Cube Script for Maya

The Rubik Cube script allows a user to model and manipulate a Rubik's cube in any Maya scene. 

Features include:
* Create a fully textured Rubik Cube
* Manually rotate any face
* Randomize the cube
* Solve the cube

All rotations are recorded as an animation which can be watched as a playback video or rendered.

The script was written in Python3 and tested in Maya 2023.

## Installation

The repo contains two files:
1. rubik.py
2. rubikCube.mb

To utilize the script with Maya, save rubik.py to your "scripts" folder in your project. Then open the script editor in your scene and open the rubik.py script. Run the script from Maya's script editor. The script can also be saved to your shelf for easy access.

The rubikCube.mb file is a pre-generated scene with the modeled cube. The script is already loaded into a custom shelf. Simply download and open to scene in Maya.
